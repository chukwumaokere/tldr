tldr.click

Hmm I wanna figure out the framework for this idea so right now it’s just an idea we can spitball about   
Probably will get started tomorrow or weekend   
a new site called tldr.gg that aims to take current media’s biggest news and summarize it to 5 bullet points   
tldr.gg/coronavirus will return a page like this:    

Coronavirus:   
• 1,000 cases word wide currently    
• 50 deaths since emergence in 2019     
• has been documented as far back as 2017    
• not lethal     
• common symptoms: sneezing, coughing, diarrhea     
tldr.gg/berniesanders     
Some of this will be difficult      
But first I’ll make it a manual process where I enter the data for each page into a simple data base where it has an articleid, articlename, content   
Later I want to work on using bots and scrapers to prepare  data based on what’s popular on popular news pages and sites like reddit, then have the data cross checked before publishing   
Basically it’ll be run by AI that scrapes and documents the data and cross checks it so when people want the down and dirty about something they don’t have to sift through multiple sites to get the basic information they want   
It may even be able to handle something like tldr.gg/iphone7-vs-iphone8 and list the top 5 important differences    
That’s basically it.    
I’ll also keep a table of trusted sites so it knows where to get information from    
And list the sources in the footnotes    
Tldr.gg - Everything you wanted to know about anything, quickly    
I wanna incorporate docker, graphql, mysql database or mongo depending on scalability of the projects, public APIs, a SPA feel so there’s limited loading, sharing features, SEO Capabilities, cohesive theme and dark and light mode    
Oh and mobile friendly    
Related articles to one that someone’s viewing, featured articles (popular worldwide), popular in your area, and yeah    
Add search at the top    

Oh and a suggestion page where people can suggest articles. Or people can submit written articles but they have to get reviewed by ai or manually     
It’s the Occam’s razor of the Internet     
All the facts without the BS
