# tldr - Everything you wanted to know about anything, quickly 
## the Occamâ€™s razor of the Internet
### All the facts without the BS

a [Sails v1](https://sailsjs.com) application


### Version info

This app was originally generated on Tue Jan 28 2020 20:31:08 GMT-0600 (Central Standard Time) using Sails v1.2.3.


### Set up
* Git clone this repo
* Inside the directory run `npm install`
* then create a file in config/ named `local.js`
* Put this in `config/local.js`: 
```
module.exports = {
  datastore_url: 'mysql://mysqluser:password@localhost:3306/tldr',
};
```
* Be sure to change `mysqluser` and `password` in that `local.js` file to your mysql information. It should create the database and table for you. If not, just create the database `tldr` and it will automatically create the tables for you.
* run `node app.js`. You can also use nodemon, pm2, or some other daemon to keep the program running.
* Run the example create API's below to get started with some content.

<!-- Internally, Sails used [`sails-generate@1.16.13`](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-generate/tree/v1.16.13/lib/core-generators/new). -->



<!--
Note:  Generators are usually run using the globally-installed `sails` CLI (command-line interface).  This CLI version is _environment-specific_ rather than app-specific, thus over time, as a project's dependencies are upgraded or the project is worked on by different developers on different computers using different versions of Node.js, the Sails dependency in its package.json file may differ from the globally-installed Sails CLI release it was originally generated with.  (Be sure to always check out the relevant [upgrading guides](https://sailsjs.com/upgrading) before upgrading the version of Sails used by your app.  If you're stuck, [get help here](https://sailsjs.com/support).)
